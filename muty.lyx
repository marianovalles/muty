Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Introduce the main topic related to distributed systems covered in this
 seminar and justify its importance.
 Summarize the work you have done
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The topic discussed in this seminar were the mutual exclusion locks.
 It is an important subject of Distributed Systems, because it shows how
 a correct division of the use of a resource, or a critical zone, can reduce
 the number of not-at-all desired deadlocks in a Distributed System.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have implemented three versions of distributed locks, the first one which
 produced an excessive amount of deadlocks, the second one using priorities,
 which ended up being an unfair schedule, and the third one using Lamport
 clocks.
 Each of the implementations communicated through multicast messages between
 the different locks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Main issues and solutions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Summarize the main issues arised in the seminar, your proposed solutions,
 and the problems you have encountered to carry out these solutions.
 You do not need to copy&paste your code.
 Only if needed, you may write down small code snippets to show how you
 have solved a specific problem/question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned before, the first implementation, had the problem of being
 a really simple implementation of a lock, but it did not provide a method
 to decide which of two locks would get access to the critical zone, therefore
 resulting in a deadlock situation.
 as this was expected, after a deadlock, there was a 
\emph on
timeout 
\emph default
value in each worker to know when to give up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although lock1 worked correctly, when we increased the risk of conflict
 the deadlock situations also increase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second lock (lock2), we introduced the concept of priority of processes,
 we assigned an id to each lock, and then when two locks wanted to enter
 the critical zone, ok message was sent to the one with higher priority
 and the other one was sent to 
\emph on
wait 
\emph default
state again.

Figure

 shows the interaction of 4 processes using the proposed solution of priority
 assigment.
 The problem that arises in this scenario is that 
\series bold
P2
\series default
 after sending 
\emph on
ok
\emph default
 thus granting access to the critical zone to (
\series bold
P0
\series default
) with higher priority, could also enter the critical zone, after receiving
 a delayed 
\emph on
ok
\emph default
 message from 
\series bold
P1
\series default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve this situation, an additional request message is sent from 
\series bold
P4
\series default
 only to 
\series bold
P0
\series default
,to guarantee that the happened before order is preserved.
 This is observed in Figure .

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third implementation of the lock (lock3) also adds to the previous one,
 the use of Lamport clocks to determine the logical time a request was sent,
 in order to preserve a happened before order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We implemented a lock, that as well as incrementing its clock whenever it
 received a 
\emph on
request
\emph default
 or an 
\emph on
ok 
\emph default
message, it also saved a clock for the requests it issued, therefore entering
 the wait state with two variables storing the clock.
 The definition of the wait function was :
